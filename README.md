Assignment Summary
The test could be taken in any programming language. I have solved a total of 3 problems as part of this assignment.

Problem 1 was solved using Python.

Problem 2 and Problem 4 were solved using JavaScript, as I am more comfortable with JavaScript.

Problem 3 was found to be a duplicate of Problem 2, so I have skipped it to avoid redundancy.

Code comments are included within each solution for clarity.
